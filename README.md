 Definitions:
 “Rescaling” a vector means to add or subtract a constant and then multiply or divide by a constant, as you would do to change the units of measurement of the data, for example, to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
 
 “Normalizing” a vector most often means dividing by a norm of the vector. It also often refers to rescaling by the minimum and range of the vector, to make all the elements lie between 0 and 1 thus bringing all the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale.

“Standardizing” a vector most often means subtracting a measure of location and dividing by a measure of scale. For example, if the vector contains random values with a Gaussian distribution, you might subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation, thereby obtaining a “standard normal” random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
